He was responsible for uniting all 562 princely states of the country to build the &#10;Republic of India.&#10;&#10;About Place: October 31st, 2018, marked the inauguration of the world’s tallest statue – the Statue of Unity, against &#10;the backdrop of the dramatic Satpura and Vindhyachal hills in Kevadia, Gujarat. The 182-metre (600 feet aprox.)&#10;statue is dedicated to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the architect of independent India. The colossal monument towers &#10;over River Narmada, a tribute to India ‘from the people of Gujarat’ to the leader who placed people’s welfare first. &#10;The Statue of Unity overlooks the vast surrounds and the river basin of the Narmada River and the sprawling Sardar &#10;Sarovar dam. It stands on the Sadhu Bet hillock, connected by a 300-metre bridge, which offers access from the &#10;mainland to the statue.&#10;&#10;As a part of an outreach programme for the project, the state government had asked Indian farmers to donate their &#10;used farming equipment to collect iron needed for the statue of Sardar Patel. Eventually, about 5000 tonnes of iron is &#10;believed to be collected. Details of the construction and history of the leader can be seen in an in-house museum, &#10;inside the statue.&#10;&#10;Laser Light and Sound Show: A Light and Sound show using laser technology projected on the Statue of Unity takes &#10;place every evening except Monday. The colourful laser lighting system is accompanied by an excellent narration of &#10;the history and life of Sardar Patel, his contribution to the Independence Movement and the unification of India as &#10;one nation.&#10;&#10;Tour of Valley of Flowers: The Valley of Flowers (also known as Bharat Van), is spread across 24 acres of land and is&#10; a haven for colorful flowering plants along the bank of river Narmada. The Valley of Flower began with 48,000 &#10;plants in 2016 and has now reached up to 22,00,000 plants. Besides the parks, several photo booths and selfie points &#10;have been developed to take back fond memories of the visit. The spot resembles a rainbow of flowers setup on earth.&#10;&#10;More than 300 types of flowers are grown in this garden. A right blend of ornamental flowers, trees, shrubs, herbs, &#10;climbers and creepers are planted along with various shades of foliage, which forms the green cover in this area&#10;&#10;Tour of Sardar Sarovar Dam: The Sardar Sarovar Dam is the third highest concrete dam (163 metres) in India after &#10;Bhakra (226 metres) in Himachal Pradesh and Lakhwar (192 metres) in Uttar Pradesh. In terms of volume of &#10;concrete involved for gravity dams, this dam is ranked as the second largest in the world with an aggregate volume&#10;of 6.82 million cubic metre; only after Grand Coulee Dam in the USA with a total volume of 8.0 million cubic metre &#10;being the largest.&#10;&#10;Nauka Vihar: Gujarat State Forest Development Corporation Ltd.

The replica is&#10;about three times the estimated–original size; it measures 75 feet in length and 25 feet in height. This offers the&#10;visitors a glimpse into the evolution of the planet and mankind and is an attempt to create public awareness &#10;regarding the wealth of ancient flora and fauna of this area.&#10;&#10;Jungle Safari: A state-of-art zoological park with unique collection of indigenous and exotic animals and birds&#10;from the various biogeographic regions of the world, is located at the picturesque hills near the tallest statue&#10;of the world “The Statue of Unity” and “The Sardar Sarovar Dam” at Kevadia.
