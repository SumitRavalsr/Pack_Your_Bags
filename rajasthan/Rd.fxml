The city boasts of several attractions including the very popular, City Palace, which exhibits the rich display of artifacts of medieval period and European era. The City palace provides a spectacular view of Lake Pichola which is one of the largest and the oldest lakes in Udaipur. The complex designs made on tough grounds symbolizes the roughness and compassion of ancient rulers. The grand palace reveals a lot about the celebration and commemoration of the people and the notable strength of ordeal.&#10;&#10;History and Legend&#10;Settled on the east bank of Lake Pichola, the City Palace in Udaipur was built around 400 years back. It is regarded to be the largest royal complex in the state of Rajasthan. The palace was put up during the time when the city of Udaipur was established, by Maharana Uday Singh and his successors in 1559. The Maharanas used to live in the palace and administer their kingdom.&#10;&#10;Legends say that year before when the Maharana Uday Singh was on a hunting trail on the hills of Udaipur, he met a hermit who was meditating on the hill top. He advised Maharana to construct a palace at that very place where he was meditating. And so, the palace complex was built here on the hill top offering an awe-inspiring view of the city.  &#10;&#10;&#10;Structures within the City Palace complex&#10;The City Palace complex has a number of structures that boast of splendid architecture, making it a must visit tourist destination for history lovers.&#10;&#10;The structures within the complex are:&#10;&#10;1. Gateways&#10;Also called as Pols, Gateways are the entry points to the palace complex. There are three major gateways to the complex. 'Badi Pol' (Great Gate) is the main entry point to the complex that leads to the first courtyard. After crossing the ‘Badi Pol’, one encounters a triple arched gate called as ‘Tripola’, the northern entry to the complex.&#10;&#10;The two gates - 'Badi Pol' and ‘Tripola’ are aligned beautifully with eight marble arches or Toranas. According to the legends, the Maharanas used to weigh themselves against gold and silver here, which was later distributed among the local people.&#10;&#10;&#10;Once through the ‘Tripolia’ gate, an arena near the Toran Pol is encountered where elephant fights were held in the past. These elephants were later chosen for war campaigns according to their prowess. Across Tripolia gate there is another gate known as ‘Elephant gate’ or the ‘Hathi Pol’.&#10;&#10;2. Amar Vilas&#10;Located at the highest point of the City Palace, Amar Vilas is an elevated garden that serves as the topmost court within the complex. Built in Mughal style architecture, Amar Vilas is the entry point to Badi Mahal, another alluring structure within the complex.&#10;&#10;Adorned with beautiful hanging gardens, fountains, towers and terraces, Amar Vilas served as a leisure home for the Maharanas.&#10;&#10;3. Badi Mahal&#10;Also known as Great Palace/Garden Palace, Badi Mahal is the main palace in the complex that sits magnificently on a 89 ft high rock formation. Badi Mahal houses a swimming pool which was used for Holi celebrations in the past, and a hall that exhibits miniature paintings of 18th and 19th centuries.&#10;&#10;The beautiful wall paintings of Jag Mandir, Lord Vishnu of Jagdish temple, and elephant fight scenes are some of the other attractions here.&#10;&#10;4.

Mor Chowk&#10;A part of the inner courts of the palace, Mor Chowk or Peacock square was built during the rule of Maharana Sajjan Singh, about 200 years later than the initial establishment of the palace. Three peacocks depicting the three seasons - summer, winter and monsoon magnificently adorn the walls of the Mor Chowk.&#10;&#10;Decorated with glass and mirror mosaics, the three peacocks in Mor Chowk are crafted with around 5000 glass pieces glowing brightly in blue, green and gold colors.&#10;&#10;&#10;The pictures of Lord Krishna in the apartments in front of the Chowk are worth admiring.
